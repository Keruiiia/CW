'''
Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

Example:
wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"

wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"

Notes:
all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge

0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that w * h * l is zero

the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

FORTH: the number of rolls will be a positive or null integer (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)

In Coffeescript, Javascript, Python, Ruby and Scala the English numbers are preloaded and can be accessed as:

numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve","thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen", "twenty"]
For other languages it is not preloaded and you can instead copy the above list if you desire.
